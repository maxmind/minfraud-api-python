History
-------

2.5.0 (2021-09-20)
++++++++++++++++++

* Previously, the ``py.typed`` file was not being added to the source
  distribution. It is now explicitly specified in the manifest.

2.4.0 (2021-08-26)
++++++++++++++++++

* Added the following new values to the ``/payment/processor`` validation:
  * ``cardknox``
  * ``creditguard``
  * ``credorax``
  * ``datacap``
  * ``dlocal``
  * ``onpay``
  * ``safecharge``
* Added ``rule_label`` to minFraud output ``/disposition``.
* Added ``was_3d_secure_successful`` to ``/credit_card`` validation

2.3.1 (2021-02-12)
++++++++++++++++++

* In 2.2.0 and 2.3.0, a ``KeyError`` would be thrown if the response from the
  web service did not have the ``ip_address`` key but did contain the text
  "ip_address" in the JSON body. Reported and fixed by Justas-iDenfy. GitHub
  #78.

2.3.0 (2021-02-02)
++++++++++++++++++

* You may now set a proxy to use when making web service requests by passing
  the ``proxy`` parameter to the ``AsyncClient`` or ``Client`` constructor.
* Added ``apple_pay`` and ``aps_payments`` to the ``/payment/processor``
  validation.
* You may now enable client-side email hashing by setting the keyword argument
  ``hash_email`` to ``True`` in the web-service client request methods (i.e.,
  ``score``, ``insights``, ``factors``). When set, this normalizes the email
  address and sends an MD5 hash of it to the web service rather than the
  plain-text address. Note that the email domain will still be sent in plain
  text.
* Added support for the IP address risk reasons in the minFraud Insights and
  Factors responses. This is available at ``.ip_address.risk_reasons``. It is
  an array of ``IPRiskReason`` objects.


2.2.0 (2020-10-13)
++++++++++++++++++

* Added ``tsys`` to the ``/payment/processor`` validation.
* The device IP address is no longer a required input.

2.1.0 (2020-09-25)
++++++++++++++++++

* Added ``response.ip_address.traits.is_residential_proxy`` to the
  minFraud Insights and Factors models. This indicates whether the IP
  address is on a suspected anonymizing network and belongs to a
  residential ISP.
* ``HTTPError`` now provides the decoded response content in the
  ``decoded_content`` attribute.

2.0.3 (2020-07-28)
++++++++++++++++++

* Added ``py.typed`` file per PEP 561. Reported by Árni Már Jónsson. GitHub
  #62.
* Tightened ``install_requirements`` for dependencies to prevent a new
  major version from being installed.

2.0.2 (2020-07-27)
++++++++++++++++++

* Fixed type annotation for ``locales`` in ``minfraud.webservice`` to allow
  tuples of arbitrary length. Reported by Árni Már Jónsson. GitHub #60.

  context manager to be used in ``with`` statements.
* For both ``Client`` and ``AsyncClient`` requests, the default timeout is
  now 60 seconds.
* Type hints have been added.
* Email validation is now done with ``email_validator`` rather than
  ``validate_email``.
